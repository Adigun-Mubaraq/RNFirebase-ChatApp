# RNFirebase-ChatApp
Using React Native, and Firebase as a backend service to build a chat application.

The chat application uses React Native, Expo, and Firebase as the backend service. The application contains a 
simple login system using an email address for each specific user. The user will be allowed to upload a profile picture.
The chat application will be more of a global chat room but works in real-time.
